Suffix Tries are useful for applications like pattern matching (i.e., the Ctrl+F functionality).

Why are regular tries not useful for that?
Say you have a trie that has, amongst other words, the word "bend". If we try and match any pattern that starts with b, like be, ben, bend, it will be successful. Whereas a pattern like e, or end, or nd, will not be matched.

To do that, we use something like suffix trie wherein we not only just insert the word, but all substrings of it, so that pattern matching can be done.

Though this may take higher space, and more time, it is just an initial investment.
