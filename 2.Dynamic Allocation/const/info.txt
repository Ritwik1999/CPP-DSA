The usage of const is not to restrict overwriting on a memory location.
These locations will be overwritten anyways once the program ends.

The usage of const is to reduce the access of the various paths that 
may lead to a particular memory location.

That being said, a non-const int can have a pointer
declared as pointing to a const int.

So as to determine if an action related to const refs and ptrs is allowed,
remember that refs or ptrs can have either the same access as to what 
they refer or where they point to, or lower access, but not higher access.

Lower access => Read only
Higher access => Read Write
