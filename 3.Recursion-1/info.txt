Approach any Recursion problem using PMI.

Steps:
1. Find the stopping case (where the recursion stops) i.e., the base case, where the solution is trivial.
2. Assume (do not question if it is correct) that the function is true for all i <= k (This is where you make recursive calls. Again, do not think, just assume>
3. Prove that the function is true for k+1 (i.e., perform appropriate computation on the previous result that is assumed to be true, and return this answer).

Do not think at step 2, just code, after that you can have a dry run using pen and paper.
